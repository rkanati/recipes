## Method

### The dough

- Add yeast, sugar, and oil to water, allowing the yeast to activate.

- Sift flour and salt into large bowl. Add yeast suspension, stirring to combine.

- Turn out rough dough and knead on a floured surface for 10 minutes, until a dough is formed.

- Form dough into a ball, return to bowl, cover with damp towel, and leave to prove for 1 hour or
  until doubled in size.

- Knock down the dough ball, and turn back out on to surface. Divide as necessary. Stretch out to
  near intended dimensions; the dough will not stay at this point.

- Place dough into tins, each coated with 2 tbsp of oil. Leave dough to relax for 10 minutes.

- Stretch out dough into the shape of the tin. Avoid raising sides too much. Press inner area of
  dough with fingertips.

### The sauce

- Mince the garlic. Fry in a little oil on a low heat.

- Add tomato purée to garlic and oil. Stir over low heat for a couple of minutes.

- Add passata, herbs, salt, and pepper. Reduce until around two tbsp per pizza remains.

### Assembly

- Spread sauce evenly over each pizza, leaving a narrow border of raw dough if preferred.

- Add toppings and cheese. Bake in 200°C oven for 20-30 minutes, until golden brown.
