## Method

- Chop up holy trinity vegetables and the garlic. Prepare stock.

- Splay and season the chicken thighs.

- Make sure the vegetables, garlic, bay leaves, beer, and stock are to hand.

- Prepare roux by heating oil until smoking hot, adding flour, and stirring. Do NOT leave
unattended.

- When roux is chocolate brown, add vegetables and bay leaves. Stir for a minute or so. Add garlic.

- Dilute the roux into a broth with the beer and stock. Leave on low rolling boil.

- Sear chicken thighs in a pan, both sides, until golden brown. While searing, add the remaining
seasoning to the broth, and chop the sausage.

- Add the seared thighs to the broth whole, along with the sausage. Cover with a lid and simmer for
at least one hour, ideally two.

## Ideas

- The stock needs to be _strong_.

- Add umami boosters?
    - Worcestershire

- Add Herbs?
