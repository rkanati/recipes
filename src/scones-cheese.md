## Method

- Sift dry ingredients into large bowl.

- Dice butter and add to bowl. Begin to rub butter into flour mix (as if making pastry), stopping
when none of the butter lumps are bigger than peas.

- Add yogurt (etc.) and cheese cubes to mixture. Partially incorporate into mixture using a blunt
knife and a slicing motion. Form into a very rough dough by pressing the mass down into the bowl,
flipping it, and repeating until no dry material is left. Do NOT knead the dough.

- Dust a baking tray with a little polenta or cornmeal, to prevent the scones sticking. Flatten
dough into a rough disc, about 15cm (6") across. Place on tray and cut into 6 triangular pieces.
Wash tops with milk or leftover yogurt (etc.).

- Bake in a preheated oven at 220°C for 12 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.

## Ideas

- Add grated parmesan to dough for extra cheesyness?
- Dry mustard?
- Herbs?
