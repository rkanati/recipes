Nigella's Superior Brownie Recipe

This is the recipe Mum uses from 'How to be a domestic goddess'.She always gets the texture as deliciously fudgy, whereas mine are always quite wet and soft, though still good.

the original recipe is as follows (for 48 Brownies):

375g   soft unsalted butter
375g   best quality dark chocolate (lindt 70% is best)
6      Large Eggs
1 Tbsp Vanilla Extract
500g   Caster Sugar
225g   Plain Flour
1 Tsp  Salt
300g   Chopped Walnuts

Preheat the oven to 180°C.
Line your brownie pan with foil or baking paper.
Melt the butter and chocolate together in a large heavy based saucepan.
In a bowl beat the eggs with the sugar and vanilla.
Measure the flour into another bowl and add the salt.
When the chocolate mixture has melted, let it cool a bit before beating in the eggs and sugar mixture, and then the nuts and flour.
Beat to combine and then scrape out of the saucepan into the lined brownie pan.
Bake for about 25 minutes.
When its's ready, the top should be dried to a paler brown speckle, but the middle still dark and dense and gooey.
Keep checking the brownies as they cook; remember that they will continue to cook as they cool.

To fit in a 33 x 23 x 51-2 cm pan.

Mum adds galaxy chocolate chunks which work really well, but when I add them they result in the brownies being too wet.

For recorded attempt #1 I will half the recipe above and stick to the amount of nuts specified.

For half mesurements 25 min might be a little too long, brown left the oven caught on top. Consistency was pretty good, though it was quite cakey on top but gooey on the bottom. After they cooled they were significantly firmer.

Next time I will use hazelnuts instead of walnuts as i prefer the taste.
